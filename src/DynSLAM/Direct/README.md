Very dirty drop-in code for experimental pose refinement for the instance reconstruction.

This code is meant to take an initial relative pose estimate for an object instance, and refine it by minimizing a direct alignment error function.

If it ends up working, the code should be rewritten and integrated with the main code base better.

As of August 2017, this code does NOT help improve pose estimates.
